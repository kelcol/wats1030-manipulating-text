# Emacs Wins!

I had much more fun with **Emacs** this week than expected. Firing up Nano will probably be a more automatic choice in some situations and I can appreciate why many take to Vi, but of the three **Emacs** might be my favorite. Like anything new requiring practice, I struggled to do even very basic things and at times felt like my hands were blocks of wood. My newfound awe of what I perceive to be its potential for expert users is encouragement enough though for me to keep at it. I especially liked working with the GUI version and look forward to reducing tedium with custom macros, exploring available packages, and checking out how other users customize their getups.
